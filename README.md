# Solder

## Project Purpous
This is an introduction to soldering through a hardware project. I followed the guide online very closely as I want to master my soldering skills before I apply them to the hackpad that I designed--I would rather mess up here than there haha. 

So the purpous of this project is to make a test trial for my soldering skills before I work on a more complicated project, while practicing my pcb designing skills.
